Galaxy at war is an academic Artificial Inteligence technical demo of a Real Time Strategy game developed for the course Artificial Inteligence for Computer Games at my Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I have participated in a two people team for the development of the project. We have used the Lightweight Java Game Library as the game engine of the demo.

During the course of the project we have implemented advanced AI techniques like Steering algorithms, a tactic Path Finding using the Learning Real Time A* algorithm, a ruled based system for the strategic decision making, among other.

You can watch some demo videos of how this algorithms work in my "youtube channel(Youtube channel)":https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXyL0LXwjDuQ6YfAE8JIFig
